<h2 style="text-align:center;">Scaling of the application</h2>
<p>A well designed system should be able to grow and contract as the number of grows and decreases. This is done primarily by scaling our resources.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Vertically Scaling </h3>
<p>Keep increasing the size of the memory(RAM) or processing CPU until everything is permanent. Vertical Scaling is most commonly used in 
  applications and products of middle-range as well as small and middle-sized companies. However, even after using virtualization, whenever an improved performance is targeted, the risk for downtimes with it is much higher than using horizontal scaling.
